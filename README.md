# Malibu's way home

## Description

Malibu's way home is a game where the player needs to navigate a running dog on its way home. The dog needs to jump over obstacles and collect treats on the way. The game ends if the dog hits one of the obstacles. The goal is the finish line where the owner waits for the dog in its house. A score is calculated based on the treats that the player collected.
